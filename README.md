Don't use my apikey pls.
I do not have enough money to make a server to store the apikey.

This code sucks I know and I didn't even make the AI, just what do you want me to do?!?!?  
ChatGPT has free API so why not use 'em.

EDIT
--------
My apikey has been leaked! (I shouldn't have post it on GitHub, I knew I should have used a remote server but it is what it is)

If you want to try this you can sign up to openai and get an apikey at this url:
